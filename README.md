# AstoriaUWP 0.0.0.5

Forked from: https://github.com/Ticomware/AstoriaUWP

## Abstract
"Project Astoria" remake (UWP)

Original status: Archived (Public archive)

## My actions (my 2 cents) 
1. Renamed DalvikUWPCSharp.sln onto AstoriaUWP.sln :)
2. Lite bugfix (some try...catch added to avoid accident app halts...)

## Description
